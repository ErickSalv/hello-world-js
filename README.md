# hello-world-js

Implement the function sayHello that will return a string `'<fromPerson> says "Hello!" to <toPerson>'` in which <fromPerson> is the first parameter and <toPerson> is the second parameter.
  
*NOTE*: The function `sayHello()` will be called with different inputs, such as `sayHello('A', 'B')` or even empty strings like `sayHello('', '')` so do not hard code the string. Think of the parameters fromPerson and toPerson as some variables that contain any strings. Do not overthink this assignment. You just need to concatenate strings together.
